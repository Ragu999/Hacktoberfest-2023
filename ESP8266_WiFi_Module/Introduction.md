# ESP8266_WiFi_Module
The ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your Wi-Fi network. <br>
It can act both as a ```Access Point``` (can create hotspot) or as a ```Station``` (can connect to Wi-Fi) depending on the application, hence it can easily fetch and upload data it to the internet.<br>
